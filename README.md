# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `twitter-clone-app`.

## why I created this App?

Creating clone apps can enhance my coding skills and allow me to focus on the application's structure. And I could learn T3 full stack development.

## Features
### - User Registration and Authentication
  This app incorporates authentication methods using Discord. Users have the option to create accounts by linking their Discord accounts, allowing for a streamlined registration process.
### - Timeline and Feeds
  The main feature of the app is the timeline or feed, which displays tweets from the users a person follows. The timeline is organized chronologically, with the most recent tweets appearing at the top.
### - Posting Tweets
  Users can compose and post tweets, which are short messages limited to a certain character count (often 280 characters, like on Twitter). They can include text, emojis, images, and links in their tweets.
### - Likes
  Users can interact with tweets by liking them.
### - Follow and Unfollow
  Users can follow other users to see their tweets in their timeline. This creates a network of connections and allows users to curate the content they see.
### - Responsive Design
